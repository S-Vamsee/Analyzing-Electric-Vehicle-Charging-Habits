About This Project
This repository presents a structured analysis of Electric Vehicle adoption trends and performance patterns using real world data. The goal of this project is to transform raw EV datasets into meaningful business and policy insights through data cleaning and exploratory analysis and visualization and optional predictive modeling.

As EV adoption accelerates across the United States and globally this project analyzes key questions such as How has EV adoption changed over time Which manufacturers and models are growing fastest
How does electric range vary across vehicle types?
What geographic regions show the strongest adoption trends?
Are there measurable patterns that can support forecasting?
